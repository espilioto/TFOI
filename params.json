You may need to update the Microsoft .net Framework.  \r\nLinux: Unfortunately, WPF didn't work with Wine last time I checked.\r\n\r\n#### Backstory\r\nIt all started when I realized that I had played hundreds of hours of Isaac, but had no way to compare or analyze my runs, except for my achievements and the Stats screen of course.\r\nBut that wasn't even remotely enough.  \r\nI then remembered a similar app existing for Hearthstone.\r\nOff I went to Google, and there it was, the [RebirthItemTracker].  \r\nHaving that as a base, I started developing TFOI (and using it as a reason to play more Isaac).\r\n\r\n#### Credits and thanks\r\n\r\n* [NICALiS] and [Edmund McMillen] for making this awesome game.\r\n* [This](https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/RebirthItemTracker>) project that really helped and inspired me.\r\n* My friend, Eddy Pasterino, for beta testing (usually against his will).\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nThis basically is a text parser that reads the game's log.\r\nIt identifies certain events (like picking up an item) and presents them to the user, so that anyone can catch up with just a glance.\r\n\r\n> When the run finishes, it inserts the run's data into a database.\r\n> That data will be available to the user through various screens like: \r\n> * Run log\r\n> * Item-related data \r\n> * Boss-related data\r\n> * Character-related data\r\n\r\n^ Soonâ„¢\r\n\r\n#### *Todos*\r\n* New run \r\n  * ! Database stuff !\r\n  * Confirm effects of D4 / D100 / dice rooms (must play more :D)\r\n* Items\r\n  * Past run stats\r\n* Chars \r\n  * Past run stats\r\n* Bosses\r\n  * Past run stats\r\n* Options\r\n  * TBD\r\n\r\n\r\n#### *Probably adding these*\r\n* New Run mini mode (overlay for streams etc)\r\n\r\n#### *Maybe / Luxury*\r\n* New Run \r\n  * Rebirth style pixelate menu transitions\r\n* Items\r\n  * MouseOver/click effect\r\n  * tooltip formatting\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Known bugs\r\n*Pretty sure this will fill up eventually*\r\n \r\n### License\r\n[MIT]\r\n\r\n\r\n[NICALiS]: <http://nicalis.com>\r\n[Edmund McMillen]: <https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen>\r\n[RebirthItemTracker]: <https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/RebirthItemTracker>\r\n[MIT]:<http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\r\n  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\r\n  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\r\n  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\r\n\r\n  ga('create', 'UA-69256470-1', 'auto');\r\n  ga('send', 'pageview');\r\n\r\n</script>","google":"UA-69256470-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
