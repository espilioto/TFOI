# The Finding Of Items
A run tracker and logger for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth


#### Backstory
It all started when I realized that I had played hundreds of hours of Isaac, but had no info to compare or analyze, except for my achievements and the Stats screen of course.
But that wasn't even remotely enough.  
I then remembered a similar app existing for Hearthstone.
Off I went to Google, and there it was, the [RebirthItemTracker].  
Having that as a base, I started developing TFOI (and using it as a reason to play more Isaac).


#### Usage
Windows: Just decompress and run. You may need to install the Microsoft .net Framework.  
Linux: Unfortunately, WPF didn't work with Wine last time I checked.
